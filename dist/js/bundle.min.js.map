They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods.

Upon his release, the barber, who had been suffering from memory loss about the war, is shown the new persecuted life of the Jews by many living in the Jewish ghetto, including a washerwoman named Hannah, with whom he begins a relationship. The barber is ultimately spared such persecution by Commander Schultz, who he saved in that WWI battle. The lives of all Jews in Tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by Hynkel himself, who is doing so for ulterior motives. But those motives include a want for world domination, starting with the invasion of neighboring Osterlich, which may be threatened by Benzino Napaloni.\",\n        \"actors\": [\n            \"Charles Chaplin\",\n            \"Paulette Goddard\",\n            \"Jack Oakie\"\n        ],\n        \"imdbRating\": 8.5,\n        \"posterurl\": \"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmExYWJjNTktNGUyZS00ODhmLTkxYzAtNWIzOGEyMGNiMmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SY500_CR0,0,338,500_AL_.jpg\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"title\": \"Cinema Paradiso\",\n        \"year\": \"1988\",\n        \"genres\": [\n            \"Drama\"\n        ],\n        \"ratings\": [\n            5,\n            2,\n            2,\n            8,\n            1,\n            8,\n            3,\n            4,\n            3,\n            6,\n            8,\n            7,\n            2,\n            1,\n            8,\n            8,\n            6,\n            5,\n            9,\n            4,\n            4,\n            3,\n            6,\n            1,\n            7,\n            7,\n            1,\n            4,\n            1,\n            6\n        ],\n        \"poster\": \"MV5BMjIzMTgzOTEwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUxNjcxMTE@._V1_SY249_CR0,0,168,249_AL_.jpg\",\n        \"contentRating\": \"11\",\n        \"duration\": \"PT155M\",\n        \"releaseDate\": \"1990-01-19\",\n        \"averageRating\": 0,\n        \"originalTitle\": \"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\",\n        \"storyline\": \"A famous film director remembers his childhood at the Cinema Paradiso where Alfredo, the projectionist, first brought about his love of films.

The Minister of Culture agrees but only later does Wiesler learn that the Minister sees Dreyman as a rival and lusts after his partner Christa-Maria. The more time he spends listening in on them, the more he comes to care about them. The once rigid Stasi officer begins to intervene in their lives, in a positive way, protecting them whenever possible.
